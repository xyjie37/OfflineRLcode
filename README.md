# Offline RL Test-Time Adaptation (Ongoing)

This repository is an **ongoing / work-in-progress** project on **Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) for Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL)**.

The goal is to explore practical and research-oriented techniques that adapt offline-trained agents at test time to handle distribution shifts and improve robustness, without additional online training in the standard sense.

## Status

- **Work in progress**: the codebase and experiments are actively evolving.
- Interfaces, results, and implementations may change as development continues.

## Acknowledgements

This project is built with strong inspiration and engineering reference from **OfflineRL-Kit**:

Many thanks to the authors and contributors for open-sourcing their work.
